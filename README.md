Module 4 - Functions &amp; Modules in Python


## Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function

**Description:**
This Python script defines a function `factorial()` that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion. The program demonstrates how to use recursive function Python.

**Functionality:**
- The `factorial()` function takes an integer as an argument.
- It uses 'if-else' to calculate the factorial of the number.

## Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations

**Description:**
This Python script demonstrates how to use Pythonâ€™s built-in `math` module to perform various mathematical calculations. The program performs the following operations on a user-input number:
- Calculates the square root of the number.
- Calculates the natural logarithm (log base e) of the number.
- Calculates the sine of the number, assuming the input is in radians.

**Functionality:**
- The user is prompted to input a positive number.
- The program computes the square root, natural logarithm, and sine (in radians) using functions from the `math` module.
- The results are displayed to the user.
